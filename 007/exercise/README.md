## Exercise Goal:
* Learn the basics of Neural Style Transfer
* Learn about VGG-16 
* Learn about Gram Matrices
* Learn about basics of CNNs

## Tasks:
Basic steps of the Neural Style Transfer are:
* Importing Necessary Libraries
* Loading in the feature extractor (VGG19 in this case)
* Loading in the Images
* Setting Weights and biases
* Training the Model
* Final Output

#### To get you started, We have written a minimal template like notebook:
